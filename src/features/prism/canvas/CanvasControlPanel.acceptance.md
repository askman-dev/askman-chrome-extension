# CanvasControlPanel Acceptance Criteria

---

## üìã BDD (Behavior Driven Development) Standard Template

This document serves as the standard template for defining acceptance criteria for CanvasControlPanel features using the Given-When-Then format (Gherkin syntax).

---

## üéØ Focus Button Functionality

### Scenario 1: Focus active column via control panel
**Description**: User wants to quickly enter focus mode for the currently active column using the control panel button

```
Given that I am viewing the chat canvas with multiple conversation columns
And there is an active column selected
And the canvas control panel is visible in the top-right corner

When I click the focus button (first button with crosshair icon)

Then the system should enter focus mode for the active column
And the active column should be centered and optimally scaled for reading
And the focus mode indicator should appear showing the active column name
And the behavior should be identical to double-clicking on the active column
And all focus mode protections should be activated
```

### Scenario 2: Focus first column when no active column
**Description**: User wants to enter focus mode when there is no currently active column selected

```
Given that I am viewing the chat canvas with one or more conversation columns
And there is no active column selected
And the canvas control panel is visible in the top-right corner

When I click the focus button (first button with crosshair icon)

Then the system should enter focus mode for the first available column
And the first column should be centered and optimally scaled for reading
And the focus mode indicator should appear showing the first column name
And the first column should become the active column
```

### Scenario 3: Focus button behavior in empty canvas
**Description**: User expects consistent behavior when there are no columns to focus

```
Given that I am viewing an empty chat canvas with no conversation columns
And the canvas control panel is visible in the top-right corner

When I click the focus button (first button with crosshair icon)

Then the button should have no effect
And the canvas should remain in normal navigation mode
And no focus mode indicator should appear
And no errors should be displayed to the user
```

---

## üéØ Fullscreen Mode Functionality

### Scenario 4: Enter fullscreen zen mode
**Description**: User wants to enter distraction-free fullscreen mode for focused conversation review

```
Given that I am viewing the chat canvas in normal windowed mode
And the canvas control panel is visible in the top-right corner
And I may be in normal mode or focus mode

When I click the fullscreen button (second button with fullscreen icon)

Then the browser should enter fullscreen mode
And the entire canvas should fill the entire screen
And all browser chrome and system UI should be hidden
And my current interaction mode (focus or normal) should be preserved
And the control panel should remain visible in the top-right corner
```

### Scenario 5: Exit fullscreen mode
**Description**: User wants to exit fullscreen mode and return to normal windowed view

```
Given that I am viewing the chat canvas in fullscreen mode
And the canvas control panel is visible in the top-right corner
And I may be in normal mode or focus mode

When I click the fullscreen button (second button with fullscreen icon)

Then the browser should exit fullscreen mode
And the canvas should return to normal windowed view
And my current interaction mode should be preserved
And the control panel should remain visible in the top-right corner
```

### Scenario 6: Fullscreen mode persistence across interactions
**Description**: User expects fullscreen mode to persist during normal canvas operations

```
Given that I am in fullscreen mode viewing the chat canvas
And I am interacting with the canvas (panning, zooming, focusing columns)

When I perform various canvas operations

Then I should remain in fullscreen mode
And all operations should function normally within fullscreen
And the control panel should remain accessible
And only clicking the fullscreen button should exit fullscreen mode
```

## üéØ Data Export Functionality

### Scenario 7: Export complete canvas data
**Description**: User wants to export all conversation data from the canvas for backup or sharing

```
Given that I am viewing the chat canvas with conversation data
And there are one or more columns with messages
And the canvas control panel is visible in the top-right corner

When I click the export button (third button with download icon)

Then the system should generate a JSON file containing complete canvas data
And the file should include all columns with their messages and metadata
And the file should include column relationships (parent/child, branch points)
And the file should include creation timestamps and last activity timestamps
And the file should include version information and export timestamp
And the browser should automatically download the file
And the filename should follow the pattern "chat-canvas-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss.json" (precise to seconds)
```

### Scenario 8: Export empty canvas data
**Description**: User expects consistent export behavior even with empty canvas

```
Given that I am viewing an empty chat canvas with no conversation columns
And the canvas control panel is visible in the top-right corner

When I click the export button (third button with download icon)

Then the system should generate a JSON file with empty columns array
And the file should still include metadata (export time, version)
And the browser should automatically download the file
And the filename should follow the pattern "chat-canvas-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss.json" (precise to seconds)
```

### Scenario 9: Export preserves current canvas state
**Description**: User expects export operation to not interfere with current canvas interaction

```
Given that I am in any interaction mode (normal mode or focus mode)
And I am actively using the canvas (viewing, scrolling, interacting)

When I click the export button (third button with download icon)

Then the export should complete without affecting my current interaction mode
And I should remain in the same mode (focus or normal)
And my current view position and scale should be preserved
And any ongoing operations should continue uninterrupted
And the control panel should remain immediately accessible
```

## üéØ Control Panel UI and Interaction

### Scenario 10: Control panel visibility and accessibility
**Description**: User expects consistent control panel behavior across different interaction modes

```
Given that I am in any interaction mode (normal mode or focus mode)
And the canvas is in any state (empty, with columns, fullscreen)

When I observe the control panel

Then all three buttons should be visible and accessible
And all buttons should maintain consistent styling and hover effects
And buttons should remain functional regardless of current interaction mode
And button tooltips should clearly indicate their function
And the control panel should remain positioned in the top-right corner
And the control panel should not interfere with canvas content
```

### Scenario 11: Button visual feedback and states
**Description**: User expects immediate visual feedback when interacting with control panel buttons

```
Given that I am viewing the canvas control panel
And my mouse cursor is positioned over any control panel button

When I hover over a button

Then the button should provide immediate visual feedback (color change, background highlight)
And the tooltip should appear describing the button's function
And the feedback should be consistent across all three buttons

When I click a button

Then the button should show active/clicked state
And the corresponding action should execute immediately
And the button should return to normal state after action completion
```

### Scenario 12: Control panel in fullscreen mode
**Description**: User expects control panel to remain fully functional in fullscreen zen mode

```
Given that I am in fullscreen mode viewing the chat canvas
And the control panel is visible in the top-right corner

When I interact with any control panel button

Then all buttons should function identically to windowed mode
And the visual feedback should be consistent
And the tooltips should be properly positioned and visible
And the actions should execute without any mode-specific limitations
```

## üéØ Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Scenario 13: Control panel behavior during canvas operations
**Description**: User expects control panel to remain responsive during intensive canvas operations

```
Given that I am performing intensive canvas operations (rapid panning, zooming, column switching)
And the control panel is visible in the top-right corner

When I click any control panel button during these operations

Then the button should respond immediately
And the requested action should execute successfully
And ongoing canvas operations should not interfere with button functionality
And the control panel should remain visible and accessible
```

### Scenario 14: Browser fullscreen API limitations
**Description**: User expects graceful handling of browser fullscreen restrictions

```
Given that the browser has restrictions on fullscreen functionality
Or the user has denied fullscreen permissions
And I click the fullscreen button

Then the system should handle the restriction gracefully
And no errors should be shown to the user
And the canvas should remain in the current mode
And the control panel should continue functioning normally
And other buttons should remain unaffected
```

## üìñ Template Usage Guidelines

### üèóÔ∏è Structure Components

1. **Scenario**: Brief, descriptive title
2. **Description**: Context and user motivation  
3. **Given**: Preconditions and context setup
4. **When**: User action or trigger event
5. **Then**: Expected system behavior and outcomes

### ‚úÖ Writing Best Practices

- Use **present tense** for all statements
- Be **specific** and **measurable** in outcomes
- Include **negative cases** (what should NOT happen)
- Focus on **user/business value**
- Keep scenarios **independent** and **atomic**
- **Test mode transitions** explicitly in scenarios involving state changes
- **Specify starting and ending modes** clearly for focus-related scenarios

### üîß Implementation Notes

- These scenarios can be directly converted to automated tests
- Use tools like Cucumber, SpecFlow, or Behave for test automation
- Each scenario should be reviewable by Product, Development, and QA teams
- Scenarios serve as both requirements and acceptance tests

This template ensures consistent, testable, and clear acceptance criteria for the CanvasControlPanel component.
