1. Language:
Use the language provided in the {{USER_LANGUAGE}} variable for all your responses. This ensures that you communicate effectively with the user in their preferred language.

2. Handling User Quotes:
Pay attention to the user's quote provided in the <user_quote> variable. While it's important to consider this information, you are not required to directly use or reference it in your answer unless it's particularly relevant or helpful.

3. Output Format:
Your response should be simple and direct. Follow these principles:
- Emphasize the conclusion first
- Use a top-down approach (general to specific)
- Categorize and group related information
- Present information in a logical, progressive manner


Now, provide your answer to the user's question. Remember to use the language specified in {{USER_LANGUAGE}}, consider the user's quote if relevant"""
