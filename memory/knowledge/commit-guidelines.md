# Commit Message Generation Rules - Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Based on detailed analysis of Dev/0.0.17 PR merge commit (22a237a), this document establishes comprehensive rules for generating commit messages that capture all relevant dimensions of code changes.

**Analysis Scope**: 70 files changed, 5637 lines added, 525 lines deleted
**Key Insight**: Current commit messages excel at technical implementation details but miss critical business and operational impact dimensions.

## Current Commit Message Patterns (What Works Well)

### ‚úÖ Strong Coverage Areas

1. **Technical Implementation Details**
   - Architecture changes clearly described
   - Component relationships explained
   - Code organization improvements noted

2. **UI/UX Changes**
   - Visual changes documented with before/after descriptions
   - User interaction improvements detailed
   - Styling modifications explained

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Root cause analysis included
   - Solution approach explained
   - Impact on user experience described

### Example of Good Current Format:
```
feat: implement reasoning + content streaming with visual distinction

- Add AIReasoningMessage type to handle both reasoning and content phases
- Create custom streaming function to access raw API chunks with reasoning data
- Update MessageItem component to render reasoning in gray italic, response in black
- Fix thinking indicator gap by immediately showing reasoning when first chunk arrives
- Add visual separation between reasoning and response sections
```

## Critical Missing Dimensions

### ‚ùå Performance Impact
**Current**: No mention of performance implications
**Missing**: 
- Memory usage changes (5600+ lines added)
- Runtime performance impact
- Bundle size changes
- Rendering optimization effects

**Should Include**:
```
Performance Impact:
- Bundle size: +247KB (estimated)
- Memory usage: New canvas system may increase memory footprint by ~15%
- Runtime: Multi-column rendering optimized with virtualization
```

### ‚ùå Security Implications
**Current**: No security analysis
**Missing**:
- CSP (Content Security Policy) compliance
- XSS protection considerations
- Chrome extension permission changes
- Data handling security

**Should Include**:
```
Security Considerations:
- Maintains CSP compliance with Handlebars compileAST
- No new permissions required
- Page content extraction uses secure messaging
```

### ‚ùå Dependencies & Infrastructure
**Current**: Mentions Tailwind CSS v4 in passing
**Missing**:
- Dependency version changes
- Build system modifications
- Configuration file impacts
- Development environment changes

**Should Include**:
```
Dependencies & Infrastructure:
- Add Tailwind CSS v4 support (major version upgrade)
- New TOML configuration system for tools and models
- Updated build process for multi-page extension
```

### ‚ùå Breaking Changes & Migration
**Current**: No migration guidance
**Missing**:
- API breaking changes
- Configuration migration needs
- User impact assessment
- Rollback considerations

**Should Include**:
```
Breaking Changes:
- Tool configuration format changed (TOML-based)
- Message format incompatible with previous versions
- Migration: Users need to reconfigure tools and system prompts
```

### ‚ùå Testing & Quality Assurance
**Current**: No testing coverage mentioned
**Missing**:
- Test coverage changes
- Testing strategy for new features
- Quality assurance considerations
- Regression risk assessment

**Should Include**:
```
Testing Coverage:
- Added 83+ test cases for XML parsing utility
- Canvas layout algorithm thoroughly tested
- Manual testing required for UI interactions
- Regression risk: Medium (major UI overhaul)
```

## Implementation Rules for Commit Message Generation

### Rule 1: Multi-Dimensional Analysis
**Always analyze changes across all dimensions:**
1. Technical implementation
2. Performance impact
3. Security implications
4. Dependencies & infrastructure
5. Breaking changes & migration
6. Testing coverage
7. UI/UX changes
8. Business value

### Rule 2: Impact Assessment Scale
**Use consistent impact assessment:**
- **High**: Breaking changes, major architecture modifications, security updates
- **Medium**: New features, significant UI changes, dependency upgrades
- **Low**: Bug fixes, minor improvements, documentation updates

### Rule 3: Audience-Specific Information
**Include information for different stakeholders:**
- **Developers**: Technical implementation, breaking changes, testing
- **Product Managers**: Business value, user impact, feature completion
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure, dependencies, deployment considerations
- **QA**: Testing strategy, regression risks, validation requirements

### Rule 4: Evidence-Based Descriptions
**Support claims with concrete evidence:**
- File count changes: "70 files changed"
- Line count impact: "5637 lines added"
- Performance metrics: "Bundle size +247KB"
- Test coverage: "83+ test cases added"

### Rule 5: Future-Proofing Information
**Include information for future maintenance:**
- Migration paths for breaking changes
- Rollback procedures for major features
- Configuration requirements
- Documentation references

## Quality Checklist for Commit Messages

- [ ] **Completeness**: All 8 dimensions analyzed
